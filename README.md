osu! streams can be fun


As you guys probably know, for some reason _index's streams on In _index's stream, we noticed tons of frame drops. A LOT. Someone in the chat suggested a solution and it was to use [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/) and it kinda solved the problem.

[Program demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN0zczqZflE)

Requirements:

* .NET Framework 4.0 and above
* [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/install.html#windows-binaries) installed

The program also lets you choose your favorite video player, the default is [mpv](http://mpv.io/) which is my favorite player. You can browse to your favorite one.
